											As well as being ridiculously kind and thoughtful, Jenn also has THE best sense of humour. I don't think we've ever hung out together without cackling so hard our stomachs hurt and our eyes stream.

I can remember us both being genuinely surprised when Dad looked up from the garden, saw two of his children on the roof and immediately turned white.

											<br>

											From literally the first day that Maria and I moved back to Brighton, Peach became a friend that we could rely on. It was Peach and her husband, Blake, that we called in desperation when our sofa wouldn't fit through our new front door!

				<p class="section-description">
						Save yourself the cab fare and camp in the wildflower field adjacent to the venue for £20 per tent. We will be operating an honesty box on the day, so please bring cash with you to drop in the box.
					<br>
					<br>
					 Alternatively, you can transfer it to us via <a href="http://paypal.me/wifefest/20" style="color:#f5beaa;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.
				</p><!-- /.section-description -->
				<h5>Check in/Check out</h5>
				<p class="section-description">
					Check in is from 11am on Saturday 15th July. Our ceremony will be starting at 2:30pm so please allow yourself plenty of time to pitch up and be ready to gather for 2pm.
					</p><!-- /.section-description -->
					<p class="section-description">
					There is no formal check in and the owners of Plush Tents are expecting you, so feel free to rock up and pitch up. A map of the site is available <a href="images/map.png" target="_blank" style="color:#f5beaa;text-decoration: underline;" >here</a>. You will be camping in Densworth Farm - don't worry, it will be clearly sign-posted on the day.
					<br>
					<br>
					Check out is 11am on Sunday morning.</p><!-- /.section-description -->
					<h5>Facilities</h5>
					<p>There are two compost toilets and three flushing toilets on site. These are situated in the venue and so may be a short walk from the campsite.</p>
					<p>There are four hot, gas-powered showers in the venue.</p>

					<p>The entire site is off-grid so there will not be any electricity (or WiFi!) available to you during your stay.</p>
					<p>We will be providing you with a late afternoon meal and a late evening meal on Saturday. We suggest you eat lunch before arriving!
<br>
<br>
					If you would like breakfast on Sunday you can order a breakfast hamper put together by Field &amp; Fork on the <a href="http://www.plushtentsglamping.co.uk/book-luxury-camping-chichester-goodwood-west-sussex/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;color:#f5beaa;">venue's website</a>, or you can bring your own.
					<br><br>There is a small kitchen on site, which you are welcome to use on Sunday morning if you fancy a cooked brekkie, but please be aware that as the site is off-grid there are no fridges available to keep food cool.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately fires are not permitted on the campsite, but there is a large central fire pit in the main venue surrounded by benches where you can warm up if needed!</p>
					<h5>Parking</h5>
					<p>You will be able to park your car off-road at the entrance to the campsite. Please follow the signs to where you will be camping.</p>
					<h2 class="section-title padding-top-60">
					Hotels and B&amp;B's
				</h2><!-- /.Section-title  -->
					<p>There are many hotels and B&amp;B's available in the local area. We do advise booking them promptly as July is peak season in Chichester.</p>
					<p>The venue is about 5 minutes drive from Chichester town centre - please see <a class="go-to-directions-second" style="text-decoration: underline;color:#f5beaa;cursor: pointer;">directions</a> for the postcode.</p>

				<h5>Dress code</h5>
				<p>Although we are partying in a field, we would love to see all our guests dressed smartly for the day. Think the smarter side of smart-casual! 
				<br>
				It will probably get cold in the evening so we would suggest bringing a warm jacket to wear.
				</p>
				<h5>Footwear</h5>
				<p>	The majority of the site is wood-chip flooring, so we would advise against wearing stilettos. The brides and bridal party will be in flat shoes!</p>
				<!-- <h5>Hot tub</h5>
				<p>There is a wood-fired hot tub onsite that our guests are free to use. Please refrain from getting in it before our ceremony and as there will be children attending the wedding, bathers are a necessity.</p>
				<p>If you fancy a soak, don't forget to bring a towel.</p> -->
				<!-- <p>Usual natural selection rules apply... have fun but be safe!</p> -->
				<h5>We are off-grid</h5>
				<p>The entire site is off the grid, so there is no electricity available anywhere at the venue.</p>
				<h5>Booze</h5>
				<p>We will be supplying a range of beers, wines, soft drinks and water for you to consume throughout the day, however if you fancy something different or want to ensure you are 'topped up' for the night, you are welcome to bring your own drinks. There is no corkage charge so feel free to bring whatever you fancy. As mentioned above there are no fridge facilities on site, but if you'd like your drinks to stay cool you are welcome to use the ice buckets we will be providing.</p>
				<h5>Parking</h5>
				<p>In case you didn't spot it above, there is free off-road parking at the venue.</p>
				<h5>Music out 10:30pm</h5>
				<p>As we are in the countryside and sound travels easily, the owners of the site ask that music stops at 10:30pm.</p>

				</p><!-- /.section-description -->
				<h5>Driving</h5>
				<p>Directions from London: Come off the A27 at Fishbourne Roundabout, by taking Fishbourne Exit. Then, turn right onto Salthill Road and continue to end of the road. Turn left onto the B2178, towards the village of East Ashling. Just after the sign for Oakwood School, turn right onto Chapel Lane, drive past St. Mary Sennicotts Chapel and continue down the track for 200 yards until you see a Farm Gate on your left, signposted ‘Plush Tents’. Parking is sign-posted and located in the field on your right.</p>
				<h5>Trains</h5>
				<p>Chichester train station is 4 miles away, you will need to get a taxi from there costing approximately £12.
				<br>
				<br>
				The venue is closer to Fishbourne and Bosham train stations, however there is no taxi rank and they charge a call out from Chichester.</p>
